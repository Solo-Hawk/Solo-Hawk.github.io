                <p class="desc">Before diving into this topic, I had to know what is out there, where the industry is heading:
                    <br/> What do gamers want
                    <br/> What are the best Platforms
                    <br/> What engine to use
                    <br/> Whats type of games exsists
                    <br/> Where have developers failed and succeded in
                    <br/> What technology is being used to make / play games
                    <br>
                    <br> Here you can see my extensive research into all of this and even more, finding diamonds in the rough and highlighting how some of the major titles got their place in the gamer's library</p>
