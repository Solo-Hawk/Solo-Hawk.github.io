My github.io webpage was originally made as a quick portal for the college coursework that I did. Now that I've got more work on my hands I was to make a way of displaying it all under one website.

## What it is now

My github.io URL will now be changed to my personal website to act as my portal for my college work and as a location for presenting my portfolio, here I will be linking all my current and past projects, college and personal. I want to make it as easy as possible to just be a self explanitory site for viewers to see any type of work they are interested in.

## Tasks

**Stage One**

- [x] - Organise pages (Remove uncesscary or incomplete pages)
- [ ] - Revamp design - **Current stage**

**Stage Two**

- [ ] - Revise portfolio presentation method (Following uni guides)
- [ ] - Restructure work timetable (Not really for the website but to help keep my site consistently updated)
