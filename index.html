                <p> I have alot of work that I do along side my lessons, alot of my recent work is aimed at game development. I have done a large amount of work involving making chat bots for Discord - "The Gamer's Skype". These small projects that are outside of my lessons have helped me push my large interest in game development and I have even more work from coursework in my BTEC Module.</p>
